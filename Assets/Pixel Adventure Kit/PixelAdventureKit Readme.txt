Pixel Adventure Kit
===================

Thank you for purchasing Pixel Adventure Kit!

First and foremost, this kit is a pack of retro pixel-art sprites. Static sprites can be found in the Sprites folder, while animated ones are in the Prefabs folder.
In the Prefabs folder you can also find the prefabs which are used in the SampleScene demo.

In the Unity version of this sprite pack, there is some extra content like the interactive sample scene, which (if you wish) you can use to start your own game from.

The demo uses some of the Unity's Standard Assets mainly from the 2D package, such as the CrossPlatformInput and scripts for the CharacterController.
